# OGL 
Compilation:
	Windows - compile by running `.\make.ps1` in PowerShell.
	Linux - compile by running `make`.

## Ideas:
	* Texture binding operations

	* Text rendering
	* Console and runtime commands

	* Instanced rendering 
	* Particles and visual effects

	* Lighting(ambient, diffiuse, specular)
	* Specular mapping

## Warnings:
	* GLSL compiler can optimize away redundant code, which may cause unreachable uniform variables
